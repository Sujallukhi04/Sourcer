# Sourcer – Human Resource Management System (HRMS) 

A modern, role-based Human Resource Management System (HRMS) built using Next.js, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL (NeonDB).

Sourcer digitizes and streamlines core HR operations such as employee onboarding, attendance tracking, leave management, payroll visibility, and approval workflows, delivering a secure and scalable enterprise-ready solution.

The application follows a real-world HR workflow with clear separation of responsibilities between Admins/HR Officers and Employees, ensuring efficiency, transparency, and data security.
